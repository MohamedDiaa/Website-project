            <h1 style="margin-top: 10px;">The development from Good to Exceptional</h1>
            <p style="margin-top: 10px;">
                As a spin-off from the Leibniz Institute for New Materials (INM), our ambition is high: With a view
                to
                our environment, we want to protect people and make their lives easier. Dirt-repellent coatings
                reduce
                labor and save on cleaning agents. Invisible sealants on work clothing protect skilled workers from
                chemicals, fire and odors. Antimicrobial coatings protect against smear infections during the
                Covid-19
                pandemic.

                We support and supply producers, chemical distributors and users with multifunctional
                high-performance
                coatings. In more than 70 countries, companies and consumers benefit from their advantages.

                <h1>Antimicrobial coatings</h1>
                <p>The Corona pandemic with increasing confirmed cases challenges us. New hygiene concepts are needed.
                    Before Covid-19 in mid-March, simple cleaning and disinfection was sufficient. But shortly after
                    wiping, new colonization can occur. 99% of the time, a surface is exposed to viruses and germs until
                    the next disinfection occurs. What if there was a surface that could defend itself against certain
                    viruses around the clock? Our antimicrobial coating inactivates the Sars cov-2 coronavirus 10x
                    faster, providing additional protection against the communicable disease.

                <h1>Ceramic sealants</h1>
                <p>
                    Ceramic sealants protect against UV radiation on a molecular basis. A three-dimensional crystal
                    lattice allows water to roll off due to lower surface tension. The protection remains on the entire
                    paint if you use a ph-neutral cleaner. Normally, the end user has to have his car sealed. We
                    additionally offer consumer products of ceramic coatings.

                <h1>Nano coating</h1>
                <p>
                    “Nano” (Greek: dwarf) is the part of a billionth of a meter. Ultra-thin coatings prevent limescale
                    from forming on shower stalls in the bathroom, for example, as with nano glass sealing, or simply
                    allow wine to roll off upholstery and T-shirts. Nano sealings have no effect on UV radiation – wood
                    undergoes its characteristic aging as desired, but remains free of mold and moss.

                <h1>Waterproofing spray</h1>
                <p>
                    Clothing or shoes waterproof have always been at the expense of nature in the past. Per- and
                    polyfluorinated chemicals in waterproofing spray polluted the environment. However, we have an
                    ecologically sustainable solution that works in wind and weather. Sprayed on at a distance of 30
                    centimeters, our impregnation spray technology works reliably after drying and is suitable for all
                    textiles and outdoor shoes. Gore Tex and Sympatex membranes can be re-impregnated once the effect
                    wears off.

            <h2> Liquid Guard inactivates SARSCov-2 permanently, 24/7.</h2>
            <p>
                The Interactive Research School For Health Affairs (IRSHA) succeeds in proving that Liquid Guard
                technology
                inactivates the new coronavirus SARSCoV-2. In doing so, researchers test on plastic plates, as the virus
                is
                known to survive longest on synthetic materials. Result: complete inactivation. Combined with regular
                cleaning, the Liquid Guard technology thus offers the key to permanent hygiene of surfaces in the
                Covid-19
                pandemic. The long-term effectiveness of the innovation has been proven by field studies and it is
                available
                in an increasing number of countries.
