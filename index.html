                <p style="margin-top: 10px;">
                    As a spin-off from the Leibniz Institute for New Materials (INM), our ambition is high: With a view
                    to
                    our environment, we want to protect people and make their lives easier. Dirt-repellent coatings
                    reduce
                    labor and save on cleaning agents. Invisible sealants on work clothing protect skilled workers from
                    chemicals, fire and odors. Antimicrobial coatings protect against smear infections during the
                    Covid-19
                    pandemic.

                    We support and supply producers, chemical distributors and users with multifunctional
                    high-performance
                    coatings. In more than 70 countries, companies and consumers benefit from their advantages.

                <h1>Antimicrobial coatings</h1>
                <p>The Corona pandemic with increasing confirmed cases challenges us. New hygiene concepts are needed. Before Covid-19 in mid-March, simple cleaning and disinfection was sufficient. But shortly after wiping, new colonization can occur. 99% of the time, a surface is exposed to viruses and germs until the next disinfection occurs. What if there was a surface that could defend itself against certain viruses around the clock? Our antimicrobial coating inactivates the Sars cov-2 coronavirus 10x faster, providing additional protection against the communicable disease.
