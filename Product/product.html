            <p id="pro-body">The Corona pandemic with increasing confirmed cases challenges us. New hygiene concepts are needed.
                Before Covid-19 in mid-March, simple cleaning and disinfection was sufficient. But shortly after
                wiping, new colonization can occur. 99% of the time, a surface is exposed to viruses and germs until
                the next disinfection occurs. What if there was a surface that could defend itself against certain
                viruses around the clock? Our antimicrobial coating inactivates the Sars cov-2 coronavirus 10x
                faster, providing additional protection against the communicable disease.
